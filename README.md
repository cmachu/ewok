# Hello, I'm Ewok
I'm tiny, light and cute SCSS style sheet with classes and mixins.

Like every other Ewok, I also want help you fade out, fade in, blink or glimpse!

## How?
You can use classes: ` .ewok-fade-in`, `.ewok-fade-out`, `.ewok-blink`, `.ewok-glimpse` to create animation on page load.

You can use mixins: `ewok-fade-in($time, $delay)`, `ewok-fade-out($time, $delay)`, `ewok-blink($time, $delay, $jumps)`, `ewok-glimpse($time, $delay, $jumps)` to add and customize animations on your own styles.

## See me on action!
You can find me on Forest Moon of Endor <a href="https://cmachu.github.io/ewok/">https://cmachu.github.io/ewok/</a></p>

## How to get one Ewok?
You can install me via bower: `bower install ewok --save`
